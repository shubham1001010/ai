    "a": "The adaptation of a species to its environment",
    "b": "Farmers breeding dogs for specific traits",
    "c": "A population evolving due to genetic drift",
    "d": "A species becoming resistant to a pesticide",
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Artificial selection involves humans selecting for specific traits in organisms, such as breeding dogs for particular characteristics."

    "question": "What is the term for the process by which an organism makes a copy of its DNA?",
    "a": "Transcription",
    "b": "Replication",
    "c": "Translation",
    "d": "Mutation",
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "DNA replication is the process by which an organism makes an exact copy of its DNA, ensuring that each daughter cell receives a full set of genetic material."

    "question": "Which of the following is NOT part of the central dogma of molecular biology?",
    "a": "DNA to RNA to protein",
    "b": "Replication",
    "c": "RNA to DNA to protein",
    "d": "Transcription",
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "The central dogma of molecular biology describes the flow of genetic information from DNA to RNA to protein, not from RNA to DNA."

    "question": "What is the outcome of a homozygous recessive genotype?",
    "a": "The dominant allele will be expressed",
    "b": "The recessive trait will be expressed",
    "c": "The genotype will be heterozygous",
    "d": "The organism will be a carrier of the dominant allele",
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "A homozygous recessive genotype will express the recessive trait, as both alleles are recessive."

    "d": "Blue color of a flower",
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "A genotype refers to the genetic makeup of an organism, such as being heterozygous Aa."
